# CSDS_Notes
These are some notes for the computer science classes in CWRU.
I always imagined that someone would like to share notes with me when I was a junior student, since I cannot take notes during the lecture without losing my focus. So I will share some of my notes in this repo. Most of the content is from the slides or the textbook, while I add some of my comments to help understanding.
