# User Authentication
## Digital User Authentication
- the process of establishing confidence in user  identities that are presented electronically to an information system

## User Authentication Two Functions
- Identify entity (info system users, processes acting on behalf of users, or devices) to the system, usually by presenting a credential such as a user ID

- Verify the user by the exchange of authentication information, e.g. a password

## Mechanisms for User Authentication:
- Use multifactor authentication for local and network access to privileged accounts and for network access to non-privileged accounts.
- Employ **replay-resistant** authentication mechanisms for network access
- Prevent reuse of identifiers for a defined period.
- Disable identifiers after a defined period of inactivity.
- Enforce a minimum password complexity and change of characters when new passwords are created.
- Prohibit password reuse for a specified number of generations. *
- Allow temporary password use for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.
- Store and transmit only cryptographically-protected passwords.
- Obscure feedback of authentication information
